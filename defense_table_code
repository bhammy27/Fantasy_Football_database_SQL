-- checking the table for any errors
-- knowing each defense has 1 player then the count of each player's team_code should = 99
-- this is because each team played 17 games from 2023-2021 and 16 games from 2020-2018
-- adding the 17 games * 3 and 16 games * 3 * 32 teams = 3170 rows and it should be 3168
-- I will run this query with each team code to find teams appearing over 99 times
SELECT *
FROM
	defense
WHERE
	team_code = 'PIT';
	
-- both TEN and PIT appeared 100 times indicating each may have a duplicate row
SELECT 
	SUM(games)
FROM 
	defense
WHERE
	team_code = 'MIA';
-- checking the results of this query should show duplicate weeks
SELECT *
FROM defense;
